A. Project Overview
=> This project is a simplified front-page clone of the LiveHindustan website built using Next.js and Tailwind CSS.
The main goal of the assignment was to demonstrate:
    1. Front-end layout design similar to a real media portal
    2. Dynamic data fetching from an API
    3. Proper use of Next.js features
    4. Responsiveness and SEO practices
    5. Error handling and graceful fallbacks

Although it is not a pixel-perfect clone, the structure and behavior closely resemble a real-world news website.

2.1 Layout Decisions
=> I designed the layout based on the structure of the LiveHindustan homepage:

i. Header
    Two rows
        Top row: hamburger menu, logo, search and utility icons
        Second row: horizontal navigation bar (sticky)

ii. Main Content Area
    Two-column layout (on large screens)
        Left (75%) → Main content with multiple categories
            Each category has:
                1 large hero (main article)
                3–4 smaller articles beside it
            Advertisement banners between each category section

        Right (25%) → “Latest Updates” section

iii. Footer
    Multiple horizontal rows of links
    Partner sites section
    Copyright section

This structure matches the visual hierarchy of a real news portal and highlights the most important news first.

2.2 Why Two Columns?

    i. The left column emphasizes important/featured articles
    ii. The right column provides quick access to latest news
    
This is standard for large news websites and improves readability

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

C. Data Fetching Strategy
=> I used Next.js getStaticProps with Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR).

Q) Why getStaticProps + ISR?
Ans) I chose this instead of getServerSideProps because:

    i. The page is very fast since it is statically generated
    ii. It still stays fresh due to revalidate
    iii. It reduces unnecessary API calls
    iv. It is more scalable for a media website
    v. ISR (revalidate: 600) = Page updates every 10 minutes

I used two API endpoints for variety:

1. /v2/everything for featured sections
2. /v2/top-headlines for sidebar and breaking-style content

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

D. Components Created
    I structured the project into reusable components:

| Component              | Purpose                              |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
|  Navbar.js             | Top navigation, sticky secondary row |
|  NewsCard.js           | Single article card                  |
|  CategorySection.js    | Section with hero + side list        |
|  AdBanner.js           | Advertisement placeholder            |
|  Footer.js             | Large footer with multiple rows      |
|  pages/index.js        | Main homepage layout                 |
|  pages/news/[slug].js  | Dynamic article page                 |

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

E. Data Model
=> Each article follows a simple, consistent structure:
    {
    "id": 1,
    "slug": "sample-article",
    "title": "Some news title",
    "category": "Technology",
    "image": "url",
    "excerpt": "Short summary",
    "content": "Full content",
    "publishedAt": "2025-11-25",
    "sourceUrl": "original source"
    }

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

F. Edge Case Handling
=> The following edge cases were handled properly:

1. Missing Image
If an article has no image, a placeholder is used:
    const fallbackImage = "https://placehold.co/600x400?text=No+Image";

Result: No broken UI even when images are missing.

2. No Articles Returned
If API returns an empty array, the following message is displayed:
    No news available 
    Please try again later.

This avoids crashes and makes the experience user-friendly.

3. Long Titles
Tailwind’s line-clamp is used:
    line-clamp-2
    line-clamp-3

This prevents layout breaking and keeps UI clean.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

G. Challenges Faced

Problem 1 – Next.js Image Domain Errors
    Images from NewsAPI came from random domains.
    Solution: 
        Updated next.config.js to allow all external domains.

Problem 2 – Dynamic Routing Bugs
    Initially, slug matching failed because different API endpoints returned different structures.
    Solution:
        Created createSlug() function
        Used consistent slug generation

Problem 3 – Sticky Navbar function
    The full header was sticky initially.
    Solution: 
        Split into separate rows and made only the second row sticky.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

H. AI Usage + Reflection (Part D)
=> I used AI (ChatGPT) for:

 Initial component structure
 Layout ideas
 Sample code snippets
 Error debugging
 Tailwind class suggestions

However, I did NOT blindly copy everything.

=> Where AI suggestions were wrong / suboptimal
    1. Some Tailwind layouts were grid-based instead of row-based (not matching LiveHindustan)

=> How I solved / corrected this
    1. Read Next.js and Tailwind documentation
    2. Changed grid layout to flex rows
    3. Fixed data structure mismatches
    4. Added my own logic for slicing articles and ordering sections

So final implementation is a mix of AI help + my own decisions + debugging + architecture design.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I. What I Would Improve If Given More Time?
    1. Real category-wise APIs (sports, business, state-wise news)
    2. Search functionality integration
    3. Better SEO microdata for all articles
    4. Lazy loading for images
    5. Dark mode
    6. Admin panel for managing articles

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

J. Conclusion
=> This assignment helped me understand:
    1. How real-world news websites are structured
    2. How Next.js handles data fetching, routing, and optimization
    3. How to design reusable components
    4. How to manage edge cases and fallback UI
    5. How to effectively use AI for error solving without depending on it blindly

It was a very practical and challenging project that improved both my frontend and problem-solving skills.
